Whether pursue a PhD degree

As a post-graduate student, it’s quite important for us to decide whether or not to pursue PhD degree. The road to a doctorate is long and arduous. Although there are many the obstacles, people are still willing to stay in doctorate programs because they enjoy learning for learning's sake. But the job prospects for PhD students is a very serious problem. Many PhD students hope to find a tenure-track position at a good college or research university after graduating,but in fact,it is hard to come true. In recent years,there are more than three hundred thousand doctoral student in China.
In addition,they adds that PhD courses can make them learn more advanced theory and technology,especially, transferable skills and the more rational way of thinking. 
According to the analysis, the postgraduates tend to choose to step into society and get a satisfactory job for them after graduation. To sum up, pursuing a PhD have two sides. On the one hand, no one is willing to spend more time to earn less salary. On the other hand, let's accept it, doing a PhD can be intellectually challenging, physically tiring and emotionally draining. It means that we can seek greater depth of knowledge in a specific area, a PhD is about pursuing knowledge. What is more important, it can obtain the way of thinking. A PhD degree helps you develop valuable transferable skills, which are held dear by the employers. As far as I can see, we must respect everyone’s choice and persevere in our idea.


Good taste in my eyes

According to de Botton, taste — the particular style of things you choose to surround yourself with — is an attempt at creating balance. So someone whose life is especially chaotic might be drawn to serene, minimalist interiors, while someone who felt worn down by the cares and demands of modern life might feel drawn to warm, rustic styles.
In my experience, the whole discussion about good taste is constantly under siege. I mean, who’s to say what represents good or bad taste? To a degree, good taste can be an outcome of family conditioning, or having a good-taste eye, like a gift or talent — something one is born with. Or perhaps, like a hobby, something you take pleasure in aesthetically, that enables you to feel more in touch with your creativity. Whether or not any of these characteristics are accurate, the fact of the matter is this — good taste is an outcome of taking care of all the details. And when we become familiar with taking care of our details, it’s as if a new habit becomes attached to our spirit.
According to de Botton, bad taste isn't something we need to 'fix' — because it's the symptom, not the problem. Bad taste is "a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world," and if we can only create a more just, equitable society, then gaudy excess will disappear forever.
